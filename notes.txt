to execute javascript outside the browser
Chrome - V8 Javascript Engine(most popular) 
Firefox - Spider Monkey 
Safari - Apple JS Engine 

nodejs built by Ryan Dahl
nodejs = v8 engine + C++ embedding 
nodejs is a runtime environment for javascript 

nodejs has a interactive terminal that you can pull up using the command "node"

all even version releases of node are LTS

npm = node package manager (official package manager of nodejs)
unlike in browser you can't access the window object in nodejs as its only present in the browser 
||'ly alert('') also won't work 
nodejs doesn't have any DOM related things 

npm init => command to initialize npm in the folder (creates a package.json file)
package.json => config file

you can define script is scripts part of package.json like 
scripts : {
    "start" : "node index.js",
    "dev" : "node index.js"
}
so when run "npm run dev" commands "node index.js" command gets executed
"npm start" also runs "node index.js" 
"npm run start" also runs "node index.js" 
is start something special ? "npm dev" doesn't work

Modular Programming

===========================Node Modules==============================
each .js file is a module?
you can import modules into variable using require 
const buffer = require('buffer'); //buffer is part of std ?? 

const myModule = require('./myModule.js); //here ./ means current directory
everything is a module is private by default. To access variables or functions of a module in other files you have to export it 
require() is only available in nodejs and is not available in javascript
you can also export using the exports object 

========================File Handling==================================
we use a module called "fs" to do file handling in nodejs 
"fs" module is part of nodejs. So no need to install it
if you run writeFile or writeFileSync mulitple times the files get overwritten each time 
async (all read, write, append) functions don't return anything but expect a callback function 
sync functions(all read, append and write) always return something

========================NodeJs Architechture===========================
client --(request)--> server(nodejs)

all requests are first sent into the event queue 

clients --(requests)--> eventQueue 

all the these requests are sent to the eventLoop (one by one) ???

eventLoop = it constantly tracks the eventQueue for requests if there are any it takes them one by one in FIFO manner

requests are of 2 types (1)blocking (2)nonBlocking 

blocking == synchronous tasks 
nonBlocking == asynchronous tasks 

if there is a nonBlocking(asynchronous task) in the eventQueue then the eventLoop picks it up and just executes it
if there is a blocking (synchronous task) then the eventLoop asks for a worker thread from the ThreadPool
ThreadPool = Pool of threads(workers) 
If a thread is available ThreadPool assigns one to the eventLoop
This worker thread is assigned to complete the synchronous task (blocking)
Once the job is done the worker thread returns back to the ThreadPool
If there aren't any worker threads available the the blocking request has to wait until one becomes available
So its good practice in nodejs to avoid blocking operations as much as possible

                                                    ------> nonBlocking request ----> execute immediately (thread is not blocked i.e succesive is executed while this op happens)
clients --(requests)--> eventQueue --> eventLoop  --|
                                                    ------> blocking request -----> wait for a worker thread to be assigned (thread is blocked while this task is waiting and while this is executing so further code can't be executed)


default thread pool size = 4
max thread pool size = max number of CPU cores (this can found out using os.cpus().length)

=====================================HTTP Server=======================================
callback function ?? 
its a good practice to name the entry point index.js 
difference between single quotes and double quotes in javascript 

=====================================URL================================================
URL - uniform resource locator
spaces are not allowed in url
https://www.example.com/about
"https" - prototcol
"www.example.com" - domain (human friendly name for the IP address)
"/about" - route or path 

url with nested path https://www.example.com/about/employee/1

url with query parameters https://www.example.com/about?locale=EN_GB
query parameters = extra info that can be passed with the url. usually present after the ?
there can be multiple query parameters in the url like https://www.example.com/about?locale=EN_GB&country=GB

url parsing is not parsing multiple query parameters when sent over curl

===========================HTTP METHODS=======================================
when you type a URL in the browser and press enter browser makes a GET request 
GET 
POST 
PUT(used for file transfer ??? )
PATCH 
DELETE

===========================Express Framework==================================
basically a library which replaces your handler function
express() basically returns a function which can replace the handler function
app.HTTP_METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)

===========================NodeJs Versioning==================================
"express": "^5.1.0" 
In the version number 
^   = install a version >= specified version but is compatible with the specified version(so any version between 4.18.2 and 5.0.0(not including) can be installed)(Install recommended updates, security and minor fixes automatically)
N-1 = 5(increase in this number is because of a major and possibly breaking release)(backwards compatability is not promised so it can break current code bases)
N-2 = 1(increase in this number is because of a recommended bug/security fix)
N-3 = 0(Minor Fixes)(increase in this number is because of a optional update)

"express": "~5.1.0"
~   =   install only minor fixes automatically i.e install(5.1.0 and 5.2.0(not including))

"express": "5.1.0" (install exact version)

"express" : latest (automatically install the latest version)

==========================REST API============================================
REST - Representational State Transfer 
a set of best practices regarding communication between client and server(request response cycle)
based on client - server architechture
respect the http methods(GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) don't abuse them.
Server Side Rendering(SSR) - the html, css and js code required for client is generated in the server itself. Use only when its known for sure that client is a web browser 
Client Side Rendering(CSR) - the frontend template and the data are sent seperately and they are rendered on the clients device 
SSR is usually faster for the client

Dynamic API params
/api/users/:id
here id is a dynamic param. they usually start with :

======================MIDDLEWARE=================================================
a middleware is a function that executes on every request 
usually its a pipeline of middlewares 
client ---> [middleware1] ---> [middleware2] ...... ---->[middlewareN] ---> [actual backend function]
a example of a middleware is authentication i.e. to authenticate the user and if the authentication is good then send it to the next middleware other wise drop the request
middleware function have access to three things request object, response object and the next middleware function 
app.user() ; => used define the middleware 
next() => call the next middleware
middleware can make changes to the request object i.e further middleware will see mutated request object 

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    req.authenticated = true;
    next();
})

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    req.backendReqId = uuid();
    next();
})

==================================HTTP HEADERS======================================
they contain metadata about the request
